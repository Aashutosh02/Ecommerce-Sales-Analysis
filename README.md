# Data

The dataset used in this project consists of anonymized sales transactions from an eCommerce platform. It includes various features such as:

- Order Date: Date of the transaction.
- Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.
- Product Category: Category to which the product belongs.
- Sales Amount: The dollar amount of the sales transaction.
- Customer Information: Demographics and location data of the customer.
- Region: The region from which the transaction originated.
The data underwent cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, erroneous entries, and inconsistencies.

# Key Features and Methodology

- Data Preprocessing:

Missing Data Handling: Missing values were filled or removed depending on the analysis context.
Data Formatting: Standardizing the formats for dates, currency, and numerical values to ensure consistency.
Outlier Detection: Identified outliers were analyzed and handled either through removal or transformation.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics provided insights into the central tendencies, dispersion, and distribution of the data.
Trend Analysis: Trends in revenue over time were analyzed to identify peak periods and potential causes for changes in sales performance.
Customer Analysis: Customers were segmented based on purchasing patterns and geographic location to better understand key customer groups.

- Data Visualization:

Several plots and charts were generated to visually represent the insights from the data, using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps.

- Insights Generation:

The analysis led to key findings that can be used to optimize business operations. Insights such as which products drive the most revenue, which regions offer the greatest opportunity for growth, and which time periods are the most profitable were identified.
